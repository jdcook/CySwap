    In regards to pets/animal sales on the site:  Use caution when doing this.  Both the seller and the buyer need to be careful about scams/puppy mills/etc.  If you get a bad feeling about ANY part of the transactions, you have every right to not sell or buy.  Ask questions, like why they want to buy the animal, what other pets they have, etc.  You have the right to know where your pet is going, and who will be taking care of it.  A shelter asks these questions, so should you.  Also when buying a pet, make sure you ask the right questions.  Vet care, shots, temperament of the parent animals, etc.  Research and go with your instincts.  If you think there is any suspecious activity please report the posting if they are selling, or report the user if they are buying.
